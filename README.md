### Our Methodology
Since there exists a plethora of root words and their appropriate suffixes and rules, we
decided to start with a small subset of the various sutras that can perform and convey one
particular “abhipraay” (of being worthy).
### How the Aṣṭādhyāyī does this is as follows:
  1. Take a Dhatu from the Dhatupaath and remove the IT markers
  2. Add the suffix aniyar to it after removing its IT markers
  3. Combine the two using sandhi rules
  4. Accommodate for certain changes after the Sandhi.
###The various nuances to this are as follows
  1. The Dhatus in the Dhatupaath are not listed according to their Dhatu but rather with
  IT markers for various uses.
  Hence we take this IT marked Dhatu and first remove the ITs
  2. We take the suffix aniyar and remove its IT markers
  3. The sandhi between the two words is interesting:
*       If the dhatu ends with a Hal, the penultimate swar does Guna.
*       If the dhatu ends with an AJ, the ultimate swar does a Guna
  Next, replace ultimate vowels with certain sets of letters
  6. Under certain conditions, the n in aniyar changes to ण ्and this accommodated for
